```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://xdaiisu.github.io/ds202materials/hwlabs/choco.csv")
head(choco)
```

```{r}
hist(choco$Rating)
```

Based on the histogram, it seems like that are a lot of chocoalte ratings around 3 and 4. We can see that there is an outler at 5. So, clearly there are a few choclates that are above all else.

```{r}
ggplot(choco, aes(y=Rating, x=Cocoa.Pct))+geom_point()+
  labs(x="Percentage", y="Rating", title="Percentage vs. Rating")+
  theme_bw()
```

From the above scatterplot, we can see that the rating does not depend on the percentage of the cacao.
